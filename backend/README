Backend for Friend Rescue.

Social backends were planned for both Facebook and OpenSocial. Only the
Facebook backend was implemented.

colubrid, simplejson and swfobject are copyright their respective owners. They
are included because I wanted this application to be as complete as possible.

facebook.py is a bare-bones Facebook Platform library I created based off of
whatever else is out there. At the time it was created (2008), the existing
libraries didn't have clean APIs.
