This is Friend Rescue, an App Engine-hosted Flash-based shooter for Facebook. Compiling it requires the [Flex 3 SDK](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Flex+SDK) and the [as3corelib library](http://github.com/mikechambers/as3corelib).

My sincere apologies for the lack of documentation. I blasted this project out
in two months. I was so sick of working on it afterwards that I never wanted to
touch it again. Hopefully, however, you'll find some use for it.
